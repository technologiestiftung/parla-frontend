# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

*       @tsboter @ff6347

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.

# *.js    @vogelino

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.

# *.css docs@example.com

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the octocats team in the octo-org organization owns all .txt files.

# *.txt @technologiestiftung/bots

# In this example, @@technologiestiftung/bots owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.

# /build/logs/ @technologiestiftung/bots

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.

# docs/*  dev@citylab-berlin.org

# In this example, @@technologiestiftung/bots owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.

# apps/ @technologiestiftung/bots

# In this example, @@technologiestiftung/bots owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.

# /docs/ @technologiestiftung/bots

# In this example, any change inside the `/scripts` directory
# will require approval from @technologiestiftung/bots or @technologiestiftung/dev-team.

# /scripts/ @@technologiestiftung/bots @@technologiestiftung/dev-team

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps`
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github`
# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty.

# /apps/ @technologiestiftung/dev-team
# /apps/github
